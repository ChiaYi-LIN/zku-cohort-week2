## Part 1 Hashes and Merkle Tree

In this question, we will visit the different types of hashes available in Circom (and Solidity) and grow some Merkle trees!

# ans by GPT

1. Based on the resources we provide you as well as any additional research you have done, compare the four hashes and provide explanations in four different aspects: gas cost, capacity, proof generation efficiency, and proof size. It's ok if you cannot find reference for all four aspects, just do the best you can.


> 1. Gas Cost
SHA-256: High gas cost due to its computational intensity.
Keccak-256: Lower gas cost compared to SHA-256; optimized for Ethereum (ETH 2.0).
Poseidon: Designed for zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs, offering lower gas costs compared to SHA-256 and Keccak-256.
Pedersen: Often used in ZKPs for its lower gas cost and better integration with elliptic curve operations.
> 2. Capacity
SHA-256: 256-bit output, highly secure, and widely used in various applications.
Keccak-256: 256-bit output, chosen for Ethereumâ€™s proof-of-stake due to its security and efficiency.
Poseidon: Variable capacity but optimized for ZKPs, balancing between performance and security.
Pedersen: 256-bit output, especially efficient in contexts requiring elliptic curve cryptography.
> 3. Proof Generation Efficiency
SHA-256: Less efficient in proof generation for ZKPs due to higher computational demands.
Keccak-256: More efficient than SHA-256, optimized for Ethereum, but not the most efficient for ZKPs.
Poseidon: Highly efficient for ZKPs, designed to reduce proof generation time.
Pedersen: Efficient for ZKPs, particularly when used in conjunction with elliptic curve operations.
> 4. Proof Size
SHA-256: Larger proof sizes due to higher computational complexity.
Keccak-256: Moderate proof sizes, better than SHA-256 but not optimized for minimal proof size.
Poseidon: Smaller proof sizes due to optimization for ZKPs.
Pedersen: Relatively small proof sizes, especially when used within elliptic curve contexts.
> 5. Summary
SHA-256: High gas cost, secure, less efficient for ZKPs, larger proof sizes.
Keccak-256: Moderate gas cost, efficient for Ethereum, moderate proof sizes.
Poseidon: Low gas cost, optimized for ZKPs, highly efficient, small proof sizes.
Pedersen: Low gas cost, efficient for elliptic curve contexts, small proof sizes.

2. Letâ€™s build a binary Merkle tree template in Circom and some relevant templates for leaf verification. We will use the Poseidon hash for this assignment.

    1. Fork the week2 repo and initialize all submodules. Enter the Part1 directory and install all dependencies. In circuits/MerkleTree.circom, complete the code for the following templates (feel free to add any helper templates for intermediate components and itâ€™s ok to reference existing repos as long as their licenses permit):

    2. CheckRoot: Given all 2n already hashed leaves of an n-level tree, compute the Merkle root.

    3. MerkleTreeInclusionProof: Given an already hashed leaf and all the elements along its path to the root, compute the corresponding root.

    4. Run . scripts/compile-circuit.sh && node scripts/bump-solidity.js to compile the verifier contract for MerkleTreeInclusionProof of a 3-level tree.

3. We will now create a smart contract and use the circuits from above to verify a leaf inclusion on chain. In contracts/MerkleTree.sol, complete the code so that your contract will

    1. initialize a blank (meaning all leaves are zeros) Merkle tree of 3 levels (8 leaves) in the constructor
clarification 1: assume the 0's are already hashed
clarification 2: the indexing convention of the hashes array is from bottom to top, left to right, of the tree

    2. insertLeaf(): a function to insert a new already hashed leaf and update the relevant elements in the tree

    3. verify(): a function that verifies the inclusion proof and checks that the output root from the proof is the same as the root on chain

    4. Run npx hardhat test and attach a screenshot of all the tests passing in your PDF file

    5.[bonus] In test/merkle-test.js, complete the code to verify the second leaf with the inclusion proof as well.

4. [bonus] Create a front-end UI that interacts with the above smart contract so that all of the functions can be called in the browser. The proof generation should also happen in the browser (Hint: WASM ðŸ‘€).


## Part 2 Tornado Cash

1. How is Tornado Cash Nova different from Tornado Cash Classic? What are the key upgrades/improvements and what changes in the technical design make these possible?

   Ans by GPT:
   Key Differences Between Tornado Cash Nova and Tornado Cash Classic
    Type of Asset Support:
    
    Tornado Cash Classic: Supports only a fixed set of tokens and Ether (ETH) with pre-defined deposit and withdrawal amounts. Users have to deposit and withdraw exactly the same amounts, which can limit usability and flexibility.
    Tornado Cash Nova: Supports arbitrary amounts of ERC-20 tokens and ETH, providing much more flexibility. Users can deposit and withdraw varying amounts, making the system more versatile and practical for real-world usage.
    Enhanced Privacy:
    
    Tornado Cash Classic: Users must withdraw exactly the same amount as they deposited, making it easier for on-chain observers to link deposits and withdrawals based on timing and amounts.
    Tornado Cash Nova: Uses a system of "shielded" transfers and withdrawals, where users can deposit an arbitrary amount, transfer assets within the shielded pool, and then withdraw any amount. This makes it significantly harder for an observer to link deposits and withdrawals, enhancing privacy.
    Savings Pool:
    
    Tornado Cash Classic: Does not have a mechanism to keep assets in a private state after withdrawal, meaning that once withdrawn, the privacy benefits are reduced.
    Tornado Cash Nova: Introduces a "Savings Pool" mechanism where users can keep their assets within a shielded, private state even after withdrawal. Users can withdraw in smaller amounts or transfer funds to other users without revealing their identity or transaction history.
    L2 Integration:
    
    Tornado Cash Classic: Operates solely on Ethereum's Layer 1, which can result in high gas fees during periods of network congestion.
    Tornado Cash Nova: Integrates with Layer 2 solutions, particularly with zk-rollups. This allows for cheaper transactions and faster processing while still benefiting from the privacy features of the system.
    User Experience:
    
    Tornado Cash Classic: Requires users to manually track and manage their anonymity sets, which can be complex for average users.
    Tornado Cash Nova: Improves user experience by automating many of the processes involved in maintaining privacy. It also provides a more seamless experience when interacting with the shielded pool and making transfers.
    Technical Design Enhancements
    Arbitrary Deposit and Withdrawal Amounts:
    
    Tornado Cash Nova uses zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) in a more sophisticated way to allow for arbitrary deposit and withdrawal amounts. This is enabled by a more flexible set of circuits that can handle a wider range of inputs and outputs.
    Shielded Transfer System:
    
    The introduction of a shielded transfer system allows users to move assets within the Tornado Cash Nova system without exposing any information on the public blockchain. This involves complex cryptographic proofs that ensure the integrity of the transfers without revealing transaction details.
    Layer 2 Rollups:
    
    By integrating with zk-rollups, Tornado Cash Nova can batch transactions off-chain and only commit the necessary data on-chain. This reduces gas costs and improves scalability while still maintaining the privacy guarantees provided by zk-SNARKs.
    Savings Pool Mechanism:
    
    The Savings Pool in Tornado Cash Nova uses a combination of zero-knowledge proofs and smart contracts to allow users to maintain their assets in a shielded state even after withdrawal. This is achieved through a mix of commitment schemes and cryptographic accumulators.
    Summary of Improvements
    Greater Flexibility: Arbitrary deposit and withdrawal amounts make the system more user-friendly and practical.
    Improved Privacy: Enhanced mechanisms for maintaining anonymity through shielded transfers and withdrawals.
    Cost Efficiency: Integration with Layer 2 solutions reduces transaction costs and improves scalability.
    Better User Experience: Simplified processes and improved interfaces make privacy more accessible to users.


3. What is the role of the relayers in the Tornado Cash protocols? Why are relayers needed?

4. In the Part2 directory of this weekâ€™s repo you will find a submodule that consists of a forked tornado-nova repo. Follow the README for instructions to install all dependencies and build via yarn.

    1. Run yarn test and attach a screenshot of all the tests passing to your PDF file. 

    2. In test/custom.test.js, write a test that: Alice deposits 0.1 ETH in L1 -> Alice withdraws 0.08 ETH in L2 -> assert recipient, omniBridge, and tornadoPool balances are correct.

    3. In the same file, write a test that: Alice deposits 0.13 ETH in L1 -> Alice sends 0.06 ETH to Bob in L2 -> Bob withdraws all his funds in L2 -> Alice withdraws all her remaining funds in L1 -> assert all relevant balances are correct.

    4. Copy your modified custom.test.js into week2/custom.test.modified.js for submission, so you donâ€™t have to commit the submodule.

5. [bonus] Try out Tornado Classic on Goerli testnet and attach screenshots at deposit and withdrawal in the PDF file.

## Part 3 Semaphore

1. What is Semaphore? Explain in 4-8 sentences how it works.

2. How does Semaphore prevent double signing (or double withdrawal in the case of mixers)? Explain the mechanism in 4-8 sentences.

3. A lot of applications have already been built based on derivations from Semaphore, such as for voting (e.g. AnonyVote), survey or opinion (e.g. Ninja Survey, zkAsk), and authentication (e.g. InterRep, Continuum, zkPayroll). Can you suggest two more ideas for ZK applications that can be built upon Semaphore?
